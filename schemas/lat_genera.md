Table name: `lat_genera`

This table stores lattices (free Z-modules with a nondegenerate symmetric inner product) up to local equivalence (also refered to as the genus of the lattice).

| [rank](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.dimension) | smallint | the rank of the lattice |
| nplus | smallint | the number of positive diagonal entries over R, so that a positive definite lattice has nplus equal to dimension |
| nminus | smallint | the number of negative diagonal entries over R, so that a positive definite lattice has nminus equal to 0 |
| [class_number](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.class_number) | smallint | size of the genus |
| [disc_abs](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | bigint | absolute value of determinant of Gram matrix |

| [disc_radical](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | bigint | radical of determinant of Gram matrix |
| [disc_witt](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | bigint | Witt discriminant |
| [disc_geometric](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | float4 | Geometric discriminant |
| [disc_quadratic](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | float4 | Quadratic discriminant |
| [disc_half](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | float4 | Half discriminant |
| [disc_2adic_unit](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.discriminant) | smallint | 2-adic unit discriminant |
| bad_primes | integer[] | primes dividing the determinant |
| conway_symbol | text | the Conway symbol for the genus |
| dual_conway_symbol | text | the Conway symbol of the rescaled dual genus |
| [level](https://beta.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/lattice.level) | bigint | level of lattice |
| is_even | boolean | whether the lattice is even |
| discriminant_group_invs | integer[] | Smith-style invariants for the discriminant group |
| discriminant_group_exponent | integer | Exponent of the discriminant group |
| discriminant_form | integer[] | Quadratic form on the discriminant group, as a symmetric matrix |
| adjacency_matrix | jsonb | A dictionary with primes as keys and flattened p-neighbor multi-edge adjaceny matrix as values |
| adjacency_polynomials | jsonb | A dictionary with primes as keys and factored characteristic polynomials of adjacency matrices as values (as a list of pairs (f,e) with f a list of integer coefficients and e an exponent) |
| mass | numeric[] | numerator and denominator of the mass: sum of 1/Aut(L) for L in the genus (only for definite genera) |
| theta_distinguishing_prec | smallint | The smallest nonnegative integer m with the property that if two lattices in the genus have theta series that are equal up to precision m then they are isometric |
| is_theta_distinguished | boolean | whether theta series distinguish lattices within this genus |
| hash_function | text | a string picking one of a set of possible hash functions.  The hash value stored for lattices within this genus is computed using this hash function |
| is_hash_distinguished | boolean | whether the chosen hash function distinguishes lattices within this genus |
| ambient_lattice | text | if provided, lattices in this genus are stored as the orthogonal complement of one or more vectors in the lattice with this label.  This may be instead of or in addition to storing a Gram matrix |
| scale | integer | the gcd of the entries of the Gram matrix for any lattice in this genus |
| rep | integer[] | a Gram matrix for a lattice within this genus.  Not stored if the lattices in this genus are all in lat_lattices |
