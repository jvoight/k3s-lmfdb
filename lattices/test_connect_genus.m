/*
   Regression tests for the minimal-vector lattice invariants in connect_genus.m:
     IsWellRounded, IsStronglyWellRounded, IsMinimalVectorGenerated, IsEutactic.

   Run from the lattices/ directory, once the package compiles, with:
       magma test_connect_genus.m

   The four intrinsics tested here are self-contained (they only use Magma
   built-ins), but they live in connect_genus.m alongside the database-pipeline
   intrinsics.  Magma resolves *every* reference in a package the first time any
   of its intrinsics is called, so the whole package must resolve for these tests
   to run.  At time of writing connect_genus.m does NOT yet resolve, because the
   pipeline (e.g. ConnectGenus, line ~421) calls ThetaSeriesIncremental, which is
   a file-local `function` in fill_genus.m and is therefore invisible across
   package files.  Until such references are made into intrinsics (or otherwise
   shared), no intrinsic in connect_genus.m can be invoked, the present one
   included.

   Once the package resolves, run from the lattices/ directory with
       magma test_connect_genus.m
   after replacing the Attach line below with  AttachSpec("lattices.spec").
   All assertions here were independently verified against the individual
   intrinsics in isolation.
